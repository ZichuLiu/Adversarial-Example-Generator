# Adversarial-Example-Generator
The Convolutional Networks works well in practice and across a wide range of visual recognition problems, but there are still many blind spots behind this model.
We constructed an adversarial example generator based on the MNIST dataset. The generator will introduce adversarial perturbations into the input images and make the CNN model misclassifies these images.
